## https://sujalbshirodkar-git25.github.io/simple-calculator/
Created a basic calculator web app using HTML, inline CSS, and JavaScript. Implemented arithmetic operations (+, –, ×, ÷) with real-time expression updates and result display. Used localStorage to persist calculations across sessions. Designed a clean, button-based interface and handled dynamic UI updates through DOM manipulation.
